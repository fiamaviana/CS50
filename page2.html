        <h1>Plan Your Trail!</h1>
        <img class="center" src="images/img5.jpg" alt="imagem5" style="width:600px;height:400px;">

        <p> First of all, you need to plan your trail before you go anywhere. Especially if it's your fist time doing a trail,
        it can be more difficult than you imagine if you are not prepared.
        There is a list bellow with simple things you should do before your trail:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bolder">Where to go?</li>
            <p>
                You don't have to worry about that. Fortunatelly, I alredy made a list
                of some places you can visit. Check it out on the next page!
            </p>
            <li>How long is the trail?</li>
            <p>
                If this is your fisrt track. I recommend that you start with small trails, 5km, for example, it is a good start.
                Walk slowly and enjoy the ride. But if you've done other trails, go ahead and choose one that
                will challenge you. There is no better felling than when we reach our goals.
            </p>
            <li>What to take with you?</li>
            <p>
                Bring watter, good walking shoes, a raincoat may be needed. And unless you plan on camp later,
                there is no need to bring a lot of food or other things. Don't forget to use sunscreen, especially in the summer.
            </p>
            <li>Weather</li>
            <p>
                People living in Ireland are used to this surprising and unexpected climate change.
                So, even if it's summer, check the weather before you leave. And if there is a 1% chance of rain, bring a
                raincoat with you. You'll probably need one.
            </p>
            <li>Childrens or Pets?</li>
            <p> It's a good idea to bring your children or pets to enjoy a beatiful view on a lovely day, don't you think? But
            remember to bring other things your children or pet may need, in this case, some food
            it's indispensable. </p>
