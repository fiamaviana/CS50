        <p> In fact, there are many places in Ireland where you can take a trail.
            So, another tip is search for "walking trails" using your Google Maps. The good part is that
            you can sort it by distance and choose one that is closer or easier for you get there.
            You will find so many options that I can tell you for sure that one of them interests you.

            If you have a car or can rent one, there are so many magical places you must go
            exploring them.
